#### there are key points that every developer must master :
-Conceiving The Purpose of Software  
-The Goals of Software Design  
-Full understand the systems and tools you are working with  
- Simplicity and complexity more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.  
- To solve any problem Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one.
- Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
- Don’t reinvent thing isnt  being properly maintained
- You should be reliable.
- Refactoring should be the first option.
- When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity, Write a comment to explain “WHY” not "what"
- Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can.
- Keep learning.
- Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
- Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help
